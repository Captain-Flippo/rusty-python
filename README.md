# Captain-Flippo's Rusty Python Dev Container

Welcome to my personal vscode dev container setup. To use it, make sure **docker** and **vscode** are installed. You will also need the *Dev Containers* extension for vscode.

## Getting started

To get started, simply clone the repo with

    git clone https://github.com/Captain-Flippo/rusty-python.git

open it in vscode with

    code <repo path>

and click the upper search bar. By typing

    >Dev Containers: Reopen in Container

you can start the build process. Vscode will then open a new window within the dev container.

## Features

The container contains everything needed to work with python and rust. It also will install AWS, Azure and Bitwarden CLIs, as well as additional extensions for vscode. Docker will be available within the container and a fish shell with oh-my-fish is already installed. Enjoy Coding!
